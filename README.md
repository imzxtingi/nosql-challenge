Module 12 - Eat Safe, Love NoSQL analysis

For the first part of the challenge, I looked up PyMongo/MongoDB documentation on how to convert string to decimal and string to integer. I also looked on StackOverflow to see how to find object type in PyMongo/MongoDB. 

For the second part of the challenge, I used Xpert Learning Assistant to ask why my block of code wasn't working and it told me I had a typo in one line of code that I overlooked.
